## Introduction

A practice space to learn how to use the flask micro-framework.  I will be incorporating larger complexity as project continues.  

[Basic tutorial that I'm following for flask setup](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/creating-apis-with-python-and-flask#lesson-goals)
I will be using [SQLAlchemy](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/patterns/sqlalchemy/) later to incorporate an ORM system, but will initially write direct SQL calls to database while in early stages.

### Objectives

* [X] ~~*Serve static API object to development server*~~ [2021-02-12]
* [X] ~~*Add SQLite3 and initialize database tables*~~ [2021-02-15]
* [ ] Incorporate all RESTful conventions to flask API
* [ ] Integrate ORM via SQLAlchemy
* [ ] Migrate to non-tabular database (MongoDB?)
